# Polyform Project License Language

source text for [Polyform Project](https://polyformproject.org) licenses

The Polyform Project is a group of experienced licensing lawyers and technologists developing simple, standardized, plain-language software source code licenses.  Polyform aims to fill gaps in the menu of standardized software licenses, like non-commercial, trial, and small-business-only terms.

Have a look at [`polyform.md`](./polyform.md) for the latest license language.

## Variants

Much as [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org) offers a [suite of licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/#licenses), Polyform will offer a number of variants.

Polyform's base license will be a limited, noncommercial license.  Variants will add sections to that base license:
