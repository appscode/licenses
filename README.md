# PolyForm Project License Language

source text for [PolyForm Project](https://polyformproject.org) licenses

The PolyForm Project is a group of experienced licensing lawyers and technologists developing simple, standardized, plain-language software source code licenses.  PolyForm aims to fill gaps in the menu of standardized software licenses, like non-commercial, trial, and small-business-only terms.
