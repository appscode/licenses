## Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree to them, both as strict obligations under that agreement and as conditions to all your licenses.

## Copyright License

The licensor grants you a copyright license for the software to do everything you might do with the software that would otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright in it for any permitted purpose.  However, you may not distribute the software, or make changes or new works based on the software, unless these terms grant you an additional license to do so.

## DL: Distribution License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to distribute copies of the software.  If these terms grant you an additional license to make changes and new works, your license to distribute covers distributing your changes and new works.  However, if these terms allow you to make changes and new works for internal business operations, your license to distribute does not cover distributing changes and new works made for that purpose.

## NO: Notices

You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of the software from you also gets a copy of these terms or the URL for them above, as well as copies of any plain-text lines beginning with `Required Notice:` that the licensor provided with the software.  For example:

> Required Notice: Copyright Yoyodyne, Inc. (http://example.com)

## CL: Changes and New Works License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to make changes and new works based on the software for any permitted purpose.

## Patent License

The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that covers patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able to license, that you would infringe by using the software.

## Noncommercial Purposes

Any noncommercial purpose is a permitted purpose.

## Personal Uses

Personal use for research, experiment, and testing for the benefit of public knowledge, personal study, private entertainment, hobby projects, amateur pursuits, or religious observance, without any anticipated commercial application, is use for a permitted purpose.

## Noncommercial Organizations

Use by any charitable organization, educational institution, public research organization, public safety or health organization, environmental protection organization, or government institution is use for a permitted purpose regardless of the source of funding or obligations resulting from the funding.

## Fair Use

You may have "fair use" rights for the software under the law.  These terms do not limit them.

## SB: Small Business

Use of the software for the benefit of your company is use for a permitted purpose if your company has less than 100 total individuals working as employees and independent contractors, and less than 1,000,000 USD (2019) total revenue in the prior tax year.  Adjust this revenue threshold for inflation according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics' consumer price index for all urban consumers, U.S. city average, for all items, not seasonally adjusted, with 1982â€“1984=100 reference base.

## FT: Free Trial

Use to evaluate whether the software suits a particular application for less than 32 consecutive calendar days, on behalf of you or your company, is use for a permitted purpose.

## IB: Internal Business Use

Use of the software for the internal business operations of you and your company is use for a permitted purpose.

## NX: Noncompete

It is not a permitted purpose to provide any offering that competes with the software or any other offering the licensor provides using the software.  However, if you are using the software to provide an offering that does not compete, and the licensor begins providing a competing offering using the software, you may continue using versions of the software available under these terms at that time to provide your offering, but not any later versions made available under these terms.

## No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from granting licenses to anyone else.  These terms do not imply any other licenses.

## Patent Defense

If you make any written claim that the software infringes or contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license for the software granted under these terms ends immediately.  If your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends immediately for work on behalf of your company.

## Violations

The first time you are notified in writing that you have violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software not covered by your licenses, this agreement can nonetheless continue if you come into full compliance, and take practical steps to correct past violations, within 29 days of receiving notice.  Otherwise, this agreement ends immediately, and your licenses end with it.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.***
